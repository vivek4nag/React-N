//chunking or code splitting or dynamic bundling or lazy loading or on-demand loading ==> these are same thing, basically mean we have to bundle our code into small chunks by splitting our code. initially we will not load a particular bundle of coad , but it will be loadd on demand i.e when clicked on that. We will do taht for our grocery component using lazy loading
